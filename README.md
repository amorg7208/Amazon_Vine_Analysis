## Summary
There are significantly fewer paid reviews as part of the Vine Program compared to total reviews. With a difference of over 11% between Paid 5-Star Reviews and Unpaid 5-Star Reviews, with a higher percentage favoring unpaid reviews, one could conclude that the Vine Program is unbiased. Perhaps the clientele writing unpaid reviews are not as critical as those in the Vine Program. Further analysis could be done to look at verified_purchase compared to Paid Vine Reviews vs. Unpaid Vine Reviews.
